					<h2>Employee Interview: Jessica Whichard</h2>
					<p><strong>Summary:</strong> For my first interview, I discussed organizational goals with Jessica Whichard, the Director of Communications at the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina. Her own problems with the website were similar to some issues I had already noticed, such as the lack of a mobile site and the overload of information that the viewer is presented with. Her answers helped me better understand the community driven aspect of the organization, which I think will help me unify my goals under that umbrella.</p>
					<p><strong>1. What are the overall goals of the organization?</strong></p>
						<p>"Our goals are our mission: Nourish people. Build solutions. Empower communities. We want to ensure that people have access to nutritious and an adequate amount of food, while building solutions to end hunger completely, through empowering the communities we live in with resources and support."</p>
					<p><strong>2.	What do you want your website to accomplish?</strong></p>
						<p>"We want our website to convey that mission with words and images, and also be a place to come for resources: whether that’s for people in need of food, people who want to help support, and people who are seeking more information about hunger in North Carolina."</p>
					<p><strong>3.	What specific functions does your website need?</strong></p>
						<p>"Our website needs to offer a place where people can find resources: a pantry locator, information about nutrition programs and benefits. It needs to be easy to navigate, so you don’t have to dig too much to find what’s needed. It also needs to function as a place for people to support our mission, through food, funds or time."</p>
					<p><strong>4. Does it succeed in those functions now?</strong></p>
						<p>"Our website is functional now, but it is not an easy tool to use: there’s a lot of information to weed through, and it’s not mobile-friendly. It also doesn’t reflect our organization in visuals or services offered. It takes a lot of backend manipulation to make it work and integrate with our blog, our volunteer scheduling system, and our Food Finder tool."</p>
					<p><strong>5. What does your website NOT do that you would like it to do?</strong></p>
						<p>"Our website is not mobile friendly, so very challenging for people on their phones looking for information and actions quickly. It is not well integrated with our social media channels, and it looks and operates very differently from our volunteer scheduling system. It’s very hard to update and keep current. We’re very excited that our new solution will really remedy all of these concerns!"</p>

					<h2>User Interview: Pam Long</h2>
					<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Pam Long is a potential user of the website for the Food Bank. She is also my mom. During our interview, we discussed functional problems with the website, such as the lack of a mobile site and the overload of information. She referred to the site as “visual soup”, which told me that I need to reduce the amount of options the viewer is presented with. Her overall impression of the organization as a whole was damaged by the difficult nature of the website and their dark, unapproachable color scheme. Her feedback on the feel of the site as a whole helped me understand how to enhance the first impression for potential users.</p>
					<p><strong>1. Why do you like the organization?</strong></p>
						<p>FBCENC provides food to people who need it, they keep food stored as needed for emergencies, and they are a good resource for the community</p>
					<p><strong>2.	What would you go to the website to do?</strong></p>
						<p>To find out who to contact if I needed help, to find out how to volunteer/sign up, and to learn where to donate</p>
					<p><strong>3.	Were you able to do that easily?</strong></p>
						<p>No, because there is no mobile site, there are too many options to click on</p>
					<p><strong>4. What do you notice about the site that is not working?</strong></p>
						<p>The lack of a mobile site really limits your options, the visual information is too busy, there is too much text to sort through, the overall dark color scheme and bland design are not colorful enough even though the subject is food. Overall it is visually unappealing and the copy is redundant.</p>
					<p><strong>5. What is your first impression of the organization based on the website?</strong></p>
						<p>Inconsistent information, busy/redundant visuals/copy. Overall, the website makes the organization seem unprofessional.</p>
